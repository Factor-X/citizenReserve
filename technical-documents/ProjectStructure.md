# Project Structure

Play Framework is used for the back-end; AngularJS is used for the front-end. LESS is used to compile CSS files.

## LESS

app/assets

    LESS files. LESS is a language to manipulate CSS with variables, functions and inheritance. LESS files are compiled
    into regular CSS files used by Web applications. Cf. http://lesscss.org.

    QU: How are less files compiled in the project?

## AngularJS

    The AngularJS part of the applications makes use of CoffeeScript. CoffeeScript is a language that compiles into
    JavaScript and adds Ruby, Python and Haskell-like syntax. Cf. http://coffeescript.org/
